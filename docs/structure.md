<h1 align="center">ðŸ“‚ Structure</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Predimate project workspace! This workspace is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose to facilitate the development of the platform. Here's a brief description of each directory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>data</code> - Responsible for transforming input strings into manipulatable data structures, interpreting logical formulas provided by the user.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>derived</code> - Solves logical formulas using the derived method, inferring conclusions based on given premises.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>entity</code> - Represents entities and objects relevant to the Predimate algorithm, handling the definition and management of logical entities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>inferences</code> - Resolves logical formulas using various inference methods, applying inference rules to deduce conclusions from premises.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>tablos</code> - Validates logical formulas using the tree of refutation (tabular method) approach, assessing the validity of logical expressions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>tests</code> - Contains unit tests and test cases for the Predimate algorithm, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its functionalities through comprehensive testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>truth_table</code> - Validates logical formulas using truth tables, constructing tables to determine the validity and truth values of expressions under different conditions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This organized structure enables efficient development, easy collaboration, and seamless integration of different parts of the platform. By breaking down the project into logical components, it becomes more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand for contributors and developers.</p>
<p>As you work on different aspects of the Predimate project, remember to use the appropriate directory to keep your code organized and ensure a smooth development process. Happy coding! ðŸš€</p>
