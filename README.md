The "Predimate" algorithm, created during the second semester at Ulbra by me, is a specialized tool designed to guide students through propositional logic problems <b>step by step</b>, enhancing their learning experience. It simplifies complex logic challenges into manageable steps, promoting a deeper <b>understanding</b> of the subject and improving logical reasoning skills. Predimate is a valuable educational resource for both students and educators, facilitating the acquisition of essential logical skills.
